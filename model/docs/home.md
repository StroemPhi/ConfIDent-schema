# Introduction

[ConfIDent](https://projects.tib.eu/confident) is a service platform for academic events. It aims to make the descriptive metadata on conferences and other formats of academic events permanently accessible in a high quality, through automated processes and scientific data curation. ConfIDent as a sustainable service addresses researchers who search for and publish information on academic events, as well as universities, information infrastructure institutions, specialised societies, publishers and funding agencies.
The ConfIDent Metadata Schema is a list of core metadata entities and properties chosen for an accurate and consistent identification of an academic event or academic event series.
The goal of the present schema is an alignment with [DataCiteâ€™s Metadata Schema v4.4](http://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-4.4/), in order to be able to register via DataCite a DOI for an academic event or an academic event series.
Besides the DataCite Schema v4.4 we have used the following as reference for the present schema draft:

* [Crossref Schema v4.5.0 (draft)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17hKUa2WHxeUpqEe9H0I022Ggod4ID5bmuDDNmvZQn58), 
* [Scientific Events Ontology (SEO)](https://w3id.org/seo#)
* [schema.org/Event](https://schema.org/Event) and [schema.org/EventSeries](https://schema.org/EventSeries)


This schema representation is based on this [draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gVzfEB04s8745FcC6pijcc83EX4m4cpjqP4Vnu_-fKM/).
