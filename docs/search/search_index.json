City ConfIDentRecords - This is a container to be able to bundle academic event and series data in one data file (e.g. YAML or JSON). Contributor Attendee Moderator Organizer CommitteeMember CommitteeChair ContactPerson Presenter KeynoteSpeaker Reviewer Sponsor Country Deadline EventFormatSpecification Identifier Location Metric PlannedProcess AcademicEvent - An academic event is part of the established instruments of science communication as a format for conveying the latest scientific outputs. It is defined by the meeting of researchers at a specific time and place (virtual or physical) and with a specific thematic focus to present, hear and discuss these outputs. In contrast to other forms of events, academic events should primarily serve the exchange of results and methods of scientific research and their didactic mediation. Furthermore, a significant participation of scientific organizations in the realization of an academic event is constitutive for this type of event; for example, to distinguish it from events in which researchers mainly act as external experts or with a purely legitimising function. AcademicEventSeries - An academic event series describes the set of academic events which take place on a regular basis and thus have an established common identity. This identity is constituted, for example, through institutional continuity in the hosting of a series (e.g. by a specialised society), thematic focuses and/or a common label under which a series is defined (particularly name and acronym).

Colloquia are usually part of the academic exchange in everyday university life with only one speaker, but can also take place on special occasions (anniversaries, start or end of the lecture phase, etc.) and can have more than one speaker. conference A conference is an academic event that lasts up to several days and serves as a forum for presentations on a specific topic or subject area. In addition to subject-specific conferences, there are also interdisciplinary conferences which allow both a broader focus and more specific questions on a particular (academic) problem.

Congresses have a broader thematic focus than simple conferences, take place in certain cycles, but can still target an exclusive group of participants (e.g. representatives of a single discipline). session A session is a clearly defined part of a academic event in which a small number of speakers (usually 2-5) focus on a specific topic. A session is usually formally accompanied by a session chair, who assumes the function of a moderator. poster session A poster session is a session at which poster papers are presented. talk A talk is a central part of a larger academic event, at which a specific topic is being presented in a rather short way. keynote speech A keynote speech is a special talk that has the function to set the underlying tone and summarize the core message or most important revelation of the academic event at which it is given. event track An academic event that, as a part of a larger academic event, has the function to group even smaller parts of the academic event, like sessions and talks, according to a shared theme or topic.

It is defined by the meeting of researchers at a specific time and place (virtual or physical) and with a specific thematic focus to present, hear and discuss these outputs. In contrast to other forms of events, academic events should primarily serve the exchange of results and methods of scientific research and their didactic mediation. Furthermore, a significant participation of scientific organizations in the realization of an academic event is constitutive for this type of event; for example, to distinguish it from events in which researchers mainly act as external experts or with a purely legitimising function. AcademicEventSeries - An academic event series describes the set of academic events which take place on a regular basis and thus have an established common identity. This identity is constituted, for example, through institutional continuity in the hosting of a series (e.g. by a specialised society), thematic focuses and/or a common label under which a series is defined (particularly name and acronym).
