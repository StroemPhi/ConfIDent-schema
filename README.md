# A model to describe academic events and event series.
This is the metadata schema used in the [ConfIDent](https://projects.tib.eu/en/confident/) project, a service for open research information on academic events and event series. Based on a Semantic Media Wiki (SMW) instance, this service is meant to establish a collaborative platform in which relevant context information of academic events and event series is stored. 

The intended use cases of this schema are:
  * the automatic maintainance of the application ontology used in the SMW backbone of the ConfIDent platform,
  * a specification of required metadata to make events and event series referencable via a DOI registered at DataCite,
  * a point of reference that provides mappings to other schemas that overlap with this domain.
